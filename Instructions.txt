When running any of the playbooks, ensure it is like this: 

$ ansible-playbook FILENAME.yml --extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=PASSWORD"

FILENAME: The name of the ansible playbook you want to run
PASSWORD: The sudo password to this machine

The ansible line of code runs the playbook with an additional variable for a password. This password is the VM's/Machine's
password. We have to include these due to stating we will become sudo with this line of code:
become: true
